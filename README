Guide for building
Guide for running locally

The following should be installed and callable from the command line:
    `python3.11`
    `gcloud`
    `npm`


Also need ot make soreu that the right gcloud modules are installed.
And make sure that the credentials for the database are right!


Then should be able to just run `install.sh`. If not, fiddle with it lol.

Just delete everything from my computer and do it again
npm install codemirror5 as well, don't want to have to do gitmodules
